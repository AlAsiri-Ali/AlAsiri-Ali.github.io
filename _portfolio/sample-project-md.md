## Overview

This is a sample project written as **Markdown (.md)**. With proper YAML Front Matter at the top,
Jekyll applies the collection defaults and renders it using the theme's `single` layout automatically.

## Highlights

- Uses Markdown content instead of raw HTML.
- Gets full page chrome (header, breadcrumbs, sidebar, footer).
- Appears in the Projects listing page automatically.
- Supports tags and header images/teasers.
- Table of contents enabled via `toc: true`.

## Code Example

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Ali"))
```
